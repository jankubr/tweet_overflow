Publishes your tweet with a link to the content that didn't fit.

Let's say you have a blog post and you just want to post the beginning of it to Twitter with a link to the whole thing. You can feed the tweet method of this library with the post content and the link to it. TweetOverflow posts to Twitter as much as it can from the post and appends a shortened URL to the full content to the end of the tweet. The URL is prefixed with a space unless you specify a different string. The methods returns the number of characters of the post that made it into the tweet.
